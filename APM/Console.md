This chapter describes the Application Performance Monitor (APM) Console. This is the home screen of APM. The following screenshot shows the APM Console.

The console shows recent information from the statistics, measurements, trap and log tools. 
The individual tools can be selected from the menu on the left side of the page.
These tools are described in separate chapters. This chapter describes the overall tool configuration.


## After Startup Configuration

![](attachments/Console/Settings_After_Startup.png)

This tab lets you determine which tools should run _after startup_. 
The Mendix Modeler contains a safety constant which overrules these after startup settings and enables the admin to take control of these settings.

As a protection, you can set a _Maximum log level after startup_ if the Log Tool is run after startup. 
This can prevent the Log Tool running on an unexpectedly high level after startup.

You can configure what should happen with the Performance Tool before shutdown. 
By default it will cancel a running recording, 
but you can choose to _Stop and process the Performance Tool before shutdown_. 
If you have proper protection settings, like thresholds and maximum number of microflows 
(see Performance Tool options), you can run the performance tool in a production environment.

In some cases, tools are run for a fixed period of time. 
However, running after startup usually means you want to run a specific tool all the time. 
With the option _Clear fixed period of time after startup_ you can make sure the tools will keep on running after startup.

## License Details Configuration

APM requires an application license that can be requested via email using the button in the settings dialog on the second tab.
A license is required per app. Every license has an end date.
The license code goes in the _License_ field. The _Expiry Date_ field is automatically filled.


## Log Rerouting Configuration

This option adds log messages from other sources to the Mendix logging, 
so that all log information is combined and available in the log and trap tool.

For example: javax.mail sends debug output to the console(system.out). 
With the _Java Console_ option enabled, the debug output is caught and provided to the Mendix logging.

You can manually start/stop the rerouting options. Rerouted are:
* Java standard output (system.out) and standard error (system.err) messages
* Java Util logging
* Log4j messages

## JDBC Configuration

A JDBC URL is automatically set during installation. For special cases this URL can be changed.
The URL can contain variables that are replaced on executing a JDBC statement.
You can use _$HostName_, _$PortNumber_,_$DatabaseName_, _$UserName_ and _$Password_.
They will be replaced with the current one on execution. 
This allows for production database dumps to be used without the risk of connection to the production database from a test environment after the load of a production dump.


The _Explain plan query_ is also automatically set during installation. 
This query is used with the explain plan option in the performance tool.

The remaining four options are used in the query tool to determine the output and set a timeout.


## Advanced Configuration

A default measurement graph can be selected for the console.
